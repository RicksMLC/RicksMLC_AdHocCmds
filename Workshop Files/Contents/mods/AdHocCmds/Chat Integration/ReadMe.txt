Rick's MLC AdHocCmds: Streamer.bot chat integration instructions.

The streamer.bot tool has an Import feature which imports actions and commands.
To assist in getting integration up-and-running, the RicksMLC_ChatSpawnAndSupplyInport.txt file is 
included in this directory for you to... import.

It will create two Actions: "Spawn" and "Supply"

To use them, create the channel point reward(s) and raid action that you require and assign
the corresponding Action to them.

The spawn action will spawn zombies for:
    - bit cheers: 1 zombie / bit
    - Channel Point Rewards: 5 zombies for 500 points.  12 zombies for 1000 points.
      Edit the source to change the amounts
    - Raids: A raid triggers the zombie spawn. 1 zombie per viewer.
    - Follow: Spawn 5 zombies for a follow.

Have Fun.
Rick's MLC.
