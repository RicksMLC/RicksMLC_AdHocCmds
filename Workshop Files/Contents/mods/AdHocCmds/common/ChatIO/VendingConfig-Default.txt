-- Vending Machine configuration file.
--
-- Vending machine will dispense a random "prize" from the prizes list which corresponds to
-- the tier of the cash-in. The choice of tier is based on the number of zombies in the cashed-in
-- collection, where number of zombies is between the low number and high number (inclusive) of the
-- tier.  Ie: NumZombies >= lowNumber and NumZombies <= highNumber.
--
-- Eg: Cashing in the dogtags named "Harold P. Qwerty (n of 5)" will choose a random prize from
--     the "tier2=5-9" tier "prizes2" line.
--
-- Usage - First Time (Before starting Project Zomboid):
--  1) Copy this file to "VendingConfig.txt"
--  2) Update the VendingConfig.txt file with your changes.
--  3) Remove the "-Default" text from the boot.txt file so the line reads as "VendingConfig.txt=immediate".
--  4) Start Project Zomboid and the boot.txt file will be used on game start.
--
-- Usage - Real Time Update: (Project Zomboid map is active ie: Player is in the game)
--  1) Update the VendingConfig.txt file with your changes.
--  2) Add the line "VendingConfig.txt=immediate" to the chatInput.txt file. Note this line is 
--     not commented out with "--".
--  3) Either force the update with <F10> or wait.  The chatInput.txt file is read every ten in-game
--     minutes if not forced.
--  4) After the chatInput.txt has been applied the "immediate" lines will be automatically commented 
--     out in chatInput.txt.
--
-- Customisation:
--  To add more tiers and prizes simply add a "tier" and "prizes" with the next number appended to the name.
--  Just make sure there are no gaps in the number sequence.
--
--  More than one version of this file can be created with names different to "VendingConfig.txt".  This 
--  allows for customising which items are available without having to edit the "VendingConfig.txt" file
--  every time.  The only requirement for a vending machine config file is the line "type=vendingconfig" 
--  is in the file and at least one "tier1=blah" and "prizes1=item"  is included.  To use it follow the
--  "Usage - Real Time Update" instructions above, with the name of the new file substituted for 
--  "VendingConfig.txt"
--
--  Note: Tiers, containers and prizes are not additive between different config files.  Each time the 
--        config file is loaded the existing containers, tiers and prizes are cleared and reloaded.
--        Restarting PZ will reset the Vending Machine config to the config declared in the boot.txt file.
--
--   It is strongly recommended you back up the customised files before updating this mod, as updates 
--   to the mod from the workshop may clear the ChatIO directory.
