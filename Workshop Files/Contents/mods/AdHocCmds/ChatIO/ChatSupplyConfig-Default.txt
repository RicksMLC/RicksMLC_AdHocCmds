-- Chat Supplies Config. The categories defined below are used in the ChatSupply.txt file.
--
-- Usage - First Time (Before starting Project Zomboid):
--  1) Copy this file to "ChatSupplyConfig.txt"
--  2) Update the ChatSupplyConfig.txt file with your changes. (See "Customisation" below)
--  3) Add the line "ChatSupplyConfig.txt=immediate" to the boot.txt file, if it is not 
--     alredy there.
--  4) Start Project Zomboid and the boot.txt file will be used on game start.
--
-- Usage - Real Time Update: (Project Zomboid map is active ie: Player is in the game)
--  1) Update the ChatSupplyConfig.txt file with your changes. (See "Customisation" below)
--  2) Add the line "ChatSupplyConfig.txt=immediate" to the chatInput.txt file. Note this 
--     is not commented out with "--".
--  3) Either force the update with <F10> or wait.  The chatInput.txt file is read every ten
--     in-game minutes if not forced.
--  4) After the chatInput.txt has applied the "=immediate" lines will be automatically 
--     commented out.
--
-- Customisation:
--  To add more categories simply add a line with the format "categoryName=itemNameA,itemNameB,etc"
--  to the list below. The name of the category should use only alphabetic characters (no punctuation) 
--  and should not be the word "type" as this is reserved.
--
--  More than one version of this file can be created with names different to "ChatSupplyConfig.txt".
--  This allows for customising which items are available without having to edit the "ChatSupplyConfig.txt"
--  file every time.  The only requirement for a chat supply config file is the line "type=chatsupplyconfig"
--  is in the file and at least one "categoryName=blah" line is included.  To use it follow the 
--  "Usage - Real Time Update" instructions above, with the name of the new file substituted for
--  "ChatSupplyConfig.txt"
--
--  Note: Categories are not additive between different config files.  Each time a config file is
--        loaded all categories are cleared and reloaded.
--        Restarting PZ will reset the chat supply configuration to the one specified in the boot.txt file.
--
--   It is strongly recommended you back up the customised files before updating this mod, as 
--   updates to the mod from the workshop may clear the ChatIO directory.
