-- chatInput.txt : Triggers the AdHocCmds to action the control/command files.
--
-- It is strongly recommended you back up any customised files before updating this mod, as updating this mod
-- may remove the custom files from the ChatIO directory.
--
-- Usage:
--      This "chatInput.txt" file name is hard-coded in the mod, and is the only real-time control file for the mod.
--      Note there is a boot.txt file which has the same format as this chatInput.txt file, but it is
--      only read once on startup, and the boot.txt lines are not commented out automatically.
--
--      Any uncommented filename listed below will be actioned by the mod.  This chatInput.txt file is
--      triggered by either pressing the <F10> key or waiting to be automatically read evey 10 in-game minutes.
--      
--      A file listed below can be either declared as "hourly" or "immediate".  The "hourly" files are read and 
--      actioned on the hour, and are primarily for broadcasting a regular message on Radio C.H.A.T.  The "immediate"
--      files are actioned once and then automatically commented out so they are not repeated.
--      
-- Input file types: An input file can have one of the following types:
--      radioscript         Script lines to broadcast on Radio C.H.A.T.
